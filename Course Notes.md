## Statistics

### Intro To Statistical Research Methods

**Constructs:** difficult to define and measure. It can be defined and measured in many different ways.

**Operational Definitions:** a way of turning constructs into variables we can measure.

Volume is a construct. volume is the space something takes up but we haven’t defined how we are measuring that space. (i.e. liters, gallons) Volume in liters is not a construct because it is operationally defined. Minutes is already operationally defined; there is no ambiguity in what we are measuring.

#### Population & Sample
- Population: all the individuals in a group
- Sample (n): some of the individuals in a group
- parameter: a characteristic of the population
- statistic: a characteristic of the sample
- μ: mean of a population
- x̄ bar: mean of a sample
- Sampling Error (μ - x̄): difference between the sample average & population average.

Correlation does not imply Causation.

Larger sample size is better with a good mix.

In a random sample each subject has an equal chance of being selected, and it’s more likely to approximate the population.


A variable is a value that may change or differ between individuals in an experiment. Number of Facebook friends qualifies, since each person may have a different number of friends.

### Visualizing Data

- Always organize the data based on the questions you want to answer.

**Frequency Table:** is constructed by arranging collected data values with their corresponding frequencies.
**Frequency:** a particular data value is the number of times the data value occurs.
**Relative Frequency (aka Proportion):** fraction of counts over total (frequency/total number). All proportions are always between or equal to 0 and 1. Sum is 1.
**Percentage(%):** Relative Frequency * 100. Percentage are always between or equal to 0 and 100. Sum is 100.


interval/bin/bucket

**Histogram:** is a graphical representation of the distribution of data.
- Good for visualizing the shape of a distribution.
- x-axis has the variable you're interested in, broken down into bins.
- y-axis has the frequency of values in that bin.
- Intersection of the axes is origin. Its Cartesian coordinates are (0,0) if we go zero & up in both axes.
- Bigger bin size means frequency gets bigger (more values will fall inside the bin).

**Comparison between Historgram & Bar Graph**
![Histogram vs Bar Graph](Screenshots/01.png "Histogram vs Bar Graph")

|Histogram |Bar Graph|
|No space between each bar| Some space between each bar|
|------|------|
|Shape is very important| Shape is not important|
|------|------|
|Variable on x-axis is numerical & quantitative| Variable on x-axis is categorical or qualitative|
|------|------|
|Order matters, it goes from low to high along x-axis| Order doesn't matter|


- Can always be created if you have the frequency table
Frequency Table - Good for calculating the total number in the sample/Population


The Σ symbol means the total sum. It is the Greek letter capital sigma. f stands for frequency (count), p stands for proportion.


### Central Tendency

Mean
Average is a statistic that rests at a specific spot in the middle of the distribution

Median
The value in the middle of the distribution is called the median

Mode
The value at which the frequency is highest is called the mode.
